# Minesweeper

This is my iteration of the classic Windows game "Minesweeper". The goal of the game is to reveal all positions that do not have a mine. My version of the game includes five difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme, and Legendary. In its present form, it runs in the browser via Live Server. However, I intend to host this game shortly.

Highlights of this project:
  - Typescript
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Functions
  - Arrays
